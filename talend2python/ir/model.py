"""
Intermediate representation models for Talend components.

This module defines simple data structures used to represent Talend jobs as a
directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Each component in a job is represented as a
``Node`` with an id, type, name and arbitrary configuration.  Data flows
between components are encoded as ``Edge`` instances connecting source and
target nodes.  The ``Graph`` class provides a ``topological_order`` method
which returns the nodes sorted according to their dependencies.  This is
crucial for generating code in the correct order.

            to ``False`` the connectivity check is skipped and nodes from all
            disconnected components are returned.

        incoming edges, processes them and enqueues any neighbours whose
        indegree drops to zero.  If there are cycles a ``ValueError`` is
        raised.  When ``require_connected`` is ``True`` an additional
        breadthâ€‘first search ensures that all nodes are reachable.
